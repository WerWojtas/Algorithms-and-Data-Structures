# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
These are my algorithms for Algorithms and Data Structures Course at AGH University. There are 3 sections:
<ul>
  <li>Sorting algorithms - classical sorting algorithms. There are three files containing merge sort on array and linked list, quicksort and heapsort. In offline tasks there are also radix sort and counting sort implemented.</li>
  <li>Graph algorithms - basic graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, DAG etc. More of my algorithms can be found in the Graph Algorithms repository, where I share work related to this course.</li>
  <li>Dynamic programming - contains few dynamic problems and exercises.</li>
</ul>
